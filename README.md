# Tutorial: Large Language Models for Code

The main tutorial on understanding large language models. : [Llms tutorial](https://github.com/mkhfring/Tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-code.ipynb)
- This part borrows code from [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)

The tutorial on few-shot learning for code: [Maml tutorial](https://github.com/mkhfring/Tutorial/blob/master/maml-code.ipynb)
- For the results on how few-shot learning can assist with code understanding tasks, take a look at our paper [Evaluating few-shot and Contrastive learning Methods for Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07501)
- Some parts of the codes in this section are borrowed from [Meta Learning Bert](https://github.com/mailong25/meta-learning-bert)

The tutorial on adapters: [Adapters tutorial](https://github.com/ist1373/AdaptersTutorial/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb)
- Learn how to use adapters for different code-related topics through our papers listed below:
